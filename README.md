## about me 😎

My professional roots lie in the field of project management and education within the context of culture and welfare work. Currently, I am embarking on my **adventurous journey** into the world of **coding** with **neuefische** (Hamburg). My aim is to professionalize in web development to create useful web based apps. Additionally, I am interested in project management.
