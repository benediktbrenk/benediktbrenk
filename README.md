## about me

Hi I'm Benedikt. My professional roots lie in the field of education within the context of church and welfare work. Currently, I am embarking on my **adventurous journey** into the world of **coding** with Neue Fische (Hamburg). My aim is to professionalize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create useful web applications and apps. Additionally, I am interested in project management.
