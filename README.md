## About me

Hi I'm Benedikt. My professional roots lie in the field of education within the context of church and welfare work. Currently, I am embarking on my adventurous journey into the world of coding with Neue Fische (Hamburg). My aim is to professionalize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create useful web applications and apps. Additionally, I am interested in project management.
